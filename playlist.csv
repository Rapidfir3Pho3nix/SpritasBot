Honestly, I can't stay away, I love it too much :) The Cianwood City/Ecruteak City theme is absolutely one of my favorite town themes in Pokemon.

This is one of my first remixes building up a track entirely from scratch, the piano, chiptune, were all programmed by hand and intricately crafted, the bass was played live on my new electric bass guitar and the drums were sequenced step by step. The result is a more delicate and more ""open"" sounding track than my usual hard hitting ""big beat"" approach! Hope you enjoy it, please support by visiting my channel or adding this track to your playlists. Enjoy! Does anyone know the artist who did the thumbnail? It's awesome!

Did it all by ear :) So begins Year 6! It's pretty cool that I've been doing covers on YouTube for over 5 years now, and I thought rehashing one of my old arrangements would be a fantastic way to start. (For those of you curious, yes, the Year 5 compilation will be coming your way soon, as soon as licensing clears up!) Super Mario Galaxy is such a fun game. I've only ever played Galaxy 2, personally, but from the Let's Plays I've watched of Galaxy 1, it looks amazing. I miss playing a 3D Mario game quite as big as Galaxy 1 was, so I'm definitely looking forward to what Super Mario Odyssey has to offer! DJ Cutman approached me a long time ago and asked if I'd be interested in sending him stems of one of my songs for him to remix and produce. It took a while for this to actually happen, but after I started listening to some awesome low-fi hip hop mixes by Blazo, I decided to give it a try! Cutman did a wonderful job with this track, and was fine with all the nit-picky changes that I made to this track! If this brand of music isn't exactly your thing, don't worry, this arrangement was an experiment at trying out a different style; normal videos will be resuming soon :) I make jazz covers & remixes of video game music every Saturday at 12:30 PM EST on my channel!

Pocket Camp is so wonderful. Of Nintendo's mobile games (so far as of November 2017) this one is by far the best. It doesn't feel like any sort of pay-to-win game, and the formula of the Animal Crossing series is still present and works quite well on mobile! I hope that this game hangs around for a long time. That being said, New Leaf is my favorite installment of the series on the original Nintendo consoles. Wild World was great, and City Folk added a lot of wonderful features, but New Leaf took all those features and combined them in a wonderful culmination on a handheld console. The music in all of the games is so wonderful, with unique themes to represent each character, and a HUGE compilation of widely-varied short tunes in the form of K.K. Slider's collection (one of my top 5 favorite video game characters of all time.) I decided to present this track with some lo-fi influence after experimenting with it on my arrangement of Rosalina's Comet Observatory! This time, I handled most all of the production with the assistance of my roommate Nick Smith. He contributed an awesome synth solo on this project, and helped a ton with making the mix sound clean and groovy! ♫ ""title"" from ""Animal Crossing: New Leaf"" composed by Manaka Kataoka SOCIAL MEDIA: 🐦 Twitter • • • https://twitter.com/insanerainmusic 📘 Facebook • • • https://www.facebook.com/Insaneintherainmusic 📷 Instagram • • • https://instagram.com/insaneintherainmusic ❤️ Patreon • • • http://bit.ly/supportinsane 💬 Discord Sever • • • https://discord.gg/Ju97889 🔊 Distrokid VIP Link • • • http://distrokid.com/vip/insane",,,,,,

I really like the Pikmin games, so I figured it was finally time to make something to celebrate the games! Today’s Results (and all the other versions of it) is definitely my favourite track in the series due to how relaxing and satisfying it is after a long in-game day ^^ Featured my regular lofi instruments here, like a Rhodes piano and an FM8 electric piano, along with some mellow and soothing low-pass filtered synths (made using Serum and Massive) to give a similar feeling to the original track, while still keeping things mellow and different.

I was 10 years old when DP came out and It was really exciting going on serebii to find new 4th gen leaks and Pokemon that have been revealed and I remember of a time where during a field trip everyone whipped out their DS and started battling each other with their low level Pokemon since everyone just started with the game at the time. Times were simpler in elementary school, and it's euphoric to think about the good old times. Anyway before I get too sentimental, it was fun to create something Lo-Fi again. I like the concept of it even though I didn't understand it at first, I'm hoping I've improved over the last time I did Lo-Fi since I don't think I got a good enough grasp on what the genre was or what it was about. Hopefully you guys notice too! Either way thank you for listening and thank you for reading through this xD",,,,,,

1/17/2020 15:58,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRJgR5Vaw3s,Kamex,Mario 64 Remix - File Select [Lo-fi HipHop] [Kamex],"I saw Emdasche and Glitch do it so I thought why not? xD I took a stab at this genre and I gotta say it was pretty fun to not focus so much on the production value, it was actually the opposite. Basically make it sound like it's coming out of a small radio or an old Vinyl player or something. This idea kinda came out of nowhere probably from a discord conversation. Had some fun with it and then It just kinda continued on from there. Idk it was a nice experiment and I might do more in the future. Been loving trying to replicate old styles from before my time which is why I was in such a synthwave kick before and even once tried oldschool jungle a couple of years ago. (Gotta do that again lol) Also hey, you. Yeah you. As a thank you for reading this here's a link to an alternate version. It's the version without the lo-fi stuff! :D http://www.mediafire.com/file/rl6z9ofc0bg11lr/File%20Select%20Remix%20%5BNon%20lo-fi%5D.mp3 Thumbnail Credit ➤ https://estivador.deviantart.com/art/Mario-64-DS-560171428 Featured Artist ➤ https://twitter.com/Slurku Download ➤ http://www.mediafire.com/file/6pz6vvem9kxw7b6/Mario%2064%20File%20Select%20Remix%20%5BLofi%5D.mp3 Donate if you want ➤ http://paypal.me/Kamex Patreon ➤ https://www.patreon.com/Kamex Twitter ➤ https://twitter.com/Kamex_55 Discord ➤ https://discord.gg/Jh6eAMD #mario64remix #mario64music #mario64",,,,,,

Hope you all enjoy! A note from Cutman: This is one of my first remixes building up a track entirely from scratch, the piano, chiptune, were all programmed by hand and intricately crafted, the bass was played live on my new electric bass guitar and the drums were sequenced step by step. The result is a more delicate and more ""open"" sounding track than my usual hard hitting ""big beat"" approach!

Cutman takes an 8-bit approach to LoFi Hip Hop, mixing relaxed beats with precise chiptune instrumentation, recreated from the iconic Gameboy game. The tracklist on MeowMeow & BowWow was selected to represent the significant steps in Link's journey, from awakening on the mysterious island of Koholint, to rediscovering his legendary weapon, traversing the country side, traveling through forests and dungeons, and climbing the mountain to meet the fabled Wind Fish. If you're familiar with the game, I hope you'll take extra pleasure in listening to the album in-sequence. If you didn't play Link's Awakening, I hope you can still derive the sense of adventure and excitement the game created for me. MeowMeow & BowWow was originally released on September 1st, 2013. It was arranged by Guerin McMurry and produced, mixed and mastered by Dj CUTMAN.

The soundtrack is amazing and this main theme always gets me hype! Sure there are some weird things about Octopath Traveler (your excellency) but the combat, art, design, and of course THE MUSIC is all wonderful! I love my #NintendoSwitch I started this as a #Lofi HipHop style remix, but ended up making it more of a traditional east coast hip hop instrumental style instead. I'm keeping LoFi in the title tho, because that's how YouTube will show you my video 😭 I used multiple filters, warping, and pitch shifting effects on this main theme song remix so ~technically speaking~ there is a bunch of lofi qualities. I'm particularly happy with how the bass and high end of the song move in and out in relationship to the beat, very satisfying! Hope this #Octopath beat sounds good to you~! I made this track while on vacation and I don't have access to any monitor speakers. I had to mix in headphones and on my little Macbook speakers, if I include this on an album in the future i'll certainly be sure to update.

Cutman takes an 8-bit approach to LoFi Hip Hop, mixing relaxed beats with precise chiptune instrumentation, recreated from the iconic Gameboy game. The tracklist on MeowMeow & BowWow was selected to represent the significant steps in Link's journey, from awakening on the mysterious island of Koholint, to rediscovering his legendary weapon, traversing the country side, traveling through forests and dungeons, and climbing the mountain to meet the fabled Wind Fish. If you're familiar with the game, I hope you'll take extra pleasure in listening to the album in-sequence. If you didn't play Link's Awakening, I hope you can still derive the sense of adventure and excitement the game created for me. MeowMeow & BowWow was originally released on September 1st, 2013. It was arranged by Guerin McMurry and produced, mixed and mastered by Dj CUTMAN.

Cutman takes an 8-bit approach to LoFi Hip Hop, mixing relaxed beats with precise chiptune instrumentation, recreated from the iconic Gameboy game. The tracklist on MeowMeow & BowWow was selected to represent the significant steps in Link's journey, from awakening on the mysterious island of Koholint, to rediscovering his legendary weapon, traversing the country side, traveling through forests and dungeons, and climbing the mountain to meet the fabled Wind Fish. If you're familiar with the game, I hope you'll take extra pleasure in listening to the album in-sequence.

Here's a remix of the theme that plays in the Ghost's House. Such a lovely melody ~ One theme that always stuck out to me in the original in the sad little tune that plays in the Ghost's House down by Martha's Bay. In the remake, it's very nicely done! I produced this simple remix using some drum breaks in Ableton Live. I tried to keep it simple and just make a solid beat that keeps a groove going while the game music dances along.

Cutman takes an 8-bit approach to LoFi Hip Hop, mixing relaxed beats with precise chiptune instrumentation, recreated from the iconic Gameboy game. The tracklist on MeowMeow & BowWow was selected to represent the significant steps in Link's journey, from awakening on the mysterious island of Koholint, to rediscovering his legendary weapon, traversing the country side, traveling through forests and dungeons, and climbing the mountain to meet the fabled Wind Fish. If you're familiar with the game, I hope you'll take extra pleasure in listening to the album in-sequence. If you didn't play Link's Awakening, I hope you can still derive the sense of adventure and excitement the game created for me. MeowMeow & BowWow was originally released on September 1st, 2013. It was arranged by Guerin McMurry and produced, mixed and mastered by Dj CUTMAN.

Many more adventures await you in your future, but for now, it's time for calm. Capcalm. I've had a couple more of these in mind, so they'll be filling the gap as UNDERSONG makes progress behind the scenes - and front-and-center in sunday streams! This Lo-Fi remix marks me finally assembling a proper lofi kit for myself, and may very well be my most complex mix yet, borrowing sound samples from Mega Man, Duck Tales, Chiki Chiki Boys, Super Ghouls N Ghosts and the classic ""CAPCOM"" SNES logo jingle. Subscribe for more great lo-fi remixes, barbershop quartet arrangements, swing covers of terrible intros, original music, and, of course, UNDERSONG!",,,,,,

Originally started in 2017, the remix was tabled when AZODi was scouted to produce for J/K-Pop artists. Cutman recovered the track earlier this year, and refined it mixing a lofi hip hop sensibility with a more mainstream RnB sound. Is it safe to call that Chill Hop? :D Aerith's theme is lush and expressive, balancing both the delicate character theme and the dark, sprawling world in which she inhabits. ▾ Follow Dj CUTMAN ▾ http://youtube.com/DjCUTMAN http://twitter.com/VideoGameDJ http://instagram.com/VideoGameDJ http://soundcloud.com/DjCUTMAN http://facebook.com/DjCUTMAN ▾ Follow AZODi ▾ http://youtube.com/channel/UCg4gPSPLaOfS5fdreZ0yoZA http://patreon.com/AZODi/ http://instagram.com/azodi000/ http://twitter.com/AZODi000 ▾ GAMECHOPS on SPOTIFY▾ http://bit.ly/gamechopsspotify ▾ YOUTUBE PLAYLISTS ▾ https://www.youtube.com/user/gamechops/playlists?flow=list&sort=dd&view=1 ▾ ABOUT GAMECHOPS ▾ GameChops is a record label dedicated to video game music.

Composed by Koji Kondo DOWNLOAD THIS COVER: ➤ SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE MUSIC ➤ Subscribe! https://goo.gl/drbcr0 So this one's kinda weird. This is for Soundole's Chill Out Contest, and I was kinda stuck on what I wanted to do. I thought it would be too simple to just do a lofi cover as fun as that is, so I added a bunch of extra stuff in like the intro and that strange section in the middle. I think it sounds really cool honestly, and it took a lot of work to get it to sound like this. I took in a lot of inspiration, but the biggest one for this cover would have to be Quickly, Quickly. He's a great producer, and you guys should check him out if you're trying to relax or study or something. The video was also interesting. i wanted to make sure the feeling of the video matched the music, so I spend probably more than double the amount of work as I would on one of my regular videos. But since this video is so different, I would really really appreciate your feedback this time. I kinda like the work I put into this video, and I wouldn't mind making more videos like this one here. I really hope you guys like this one! Let me know if you'd like more covers like this! I wouldn't mind doing Lofi covers on the regular ;) next week is an anime cover bye Follow me! ➤ https://twitter.com/mohmegamusic ➤ https://facebook.com/mohmegamusic ➤ https://soundcloud.com/mohmegamusic My instruments & equipment: https://kit.com/Mohmega",,,,,,

Subscribe and support Dj CUTMAN ► http://bit.ly/djcutman Produced in 2010, I was working as a rap engineer in upstate New York, and this project happened in the after hours when I was done recording for the day. I was a video game music collector, and I had a library of hiphop beats and samples. I kept the samples in the studio in case any rap clients might need them, but I ended up using many of them for this album instead. Fun fact, this album cover became my logo for the first year or so of Dj CUTMAN, and also became a limited run of T-Shirts I still see sometimes at concerts and conventions! Originally released on January 13, 2011, this album is available on Archive.org and Bandcamp. Free downloads are enabled!
